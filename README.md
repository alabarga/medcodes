## Comorbidities

`International Statistical Classification of Diseases`, also known as ICD, is a classification system used for patient diagnosis. ICD-9 contains 13,000 codes, while ICD-10 has 68,000 codes. At the end of a patient's hospital stay, a list of ICD codes are assigned to that particular hospital admission, which ultimately gets used for reimbursement purposes.  

Comorbidity measures, such as the Charlson comorbidity index and Elixhauser score, are used to cluster the overwhelming number of ICD codes into a smaller subset of well-defined comorbidities. These tools have been used in the context of clinical prognosis and comorbidity adjustment in epidemiological outcome studies. The Charlson comorbidity index covers 17 comorbidities, while the Elixhauser score covers 30. The two comorbidity measures have 6 overlapping comorbidites: 

1. congestive heart failure
2. peripheral vascular disease
3. chronic pulmonary disease
4. hemiplegia/paraplegia
5. HIV/AIDS
6. metastatic solid tumors
